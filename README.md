    Publishing your schema gives you the power to track and manage changes. To publish your schema, all you have to do is download the apollo tool, index your GraphQL server, and run the following command. (Don't worry if this isn't possible -- there are other options to provide the schema.)
    ```npm i -g apollo```
    ```apollo schema:publish --endpoint=<your graphql endpoint here> --key="service:ntt-city-1811:PD85SrBXZFvzSIf5Bm0FxQ"```
